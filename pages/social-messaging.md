# Deploying your Rich Media bot on Social Messaging channels #

If you are building a bot you'd like to deploy on a social messaging channel using Rich Media AIML, you will need to be aware of some of the limitations on those channels compared to what the Pandorabots Chat Widget supports:

#### Button ####

Here is an example AIML with multiple postback buttons:
~~~
:
<template>
What cheese is your favorite?
<button><text>Cheddar</text><postback>I LIKE CHEDDAR CHEESE</postback></button>
<button><text>Swiss</text><postback>I LIKE SWISS CHEESE</postback></button>
<button><text>Something else</text><postback>GO TO NEXT THING</postback></button>
</template>
:
~~~
Channel details:
* Social messaging channels require that you have accompanying text before your buttons. If you create a category without accompnaying text for your buttons, our system will provide a default text of "Pick:" so the social messaging channels do not reject this message. We recommend you always include accompany text as the example above "What cheese is your favorite?"
* Facebook Messenger only supports 3 buttons and a maximum of 20 characters in the text before cropping.
* Telegram supports more than 10 buttons but button text is cropped to display buttons horizontally.
* Twilio does not render tappable buttons. Postback buttons would not work, but URL buttons will display the button text and URL link, which is tappable
* Twitter DM supports more than 10 buttons but displays them under their input field box rather than in the chat feed.
* PB Chat Widget can render the buttons without accompanying text and can support more than 10 buttons.
